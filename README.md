Experience: 3 Years as Data Analyst at Nokia Goal: Upskill to Machine Learning & Advanced Analytics within 4 weeks using only free, practical resources.
* Overview
This repository documents my day-by-day upskilling roadmap as a Data Analyst — focused on Python, SQL, and Machine Learning applied to real telecom datasets.
The end goal is to transition from a pure Data Analyst to a Data Analyst (Python + ML), capable of building predictive and business-impact projects such as:
• Customer churn prediction
• Network usage analysis
• Telecom KPI dashboards
